config BLOG
	tristate "Binary Logging Infrastructure"
	help
	  Generic binary logging infrastructure for kernel subsystems.
	  Provides efficient batched logging with binary serialization
	  and deserialization support. Modules using BLOG maintain their
	  own client mappings and debugfs interfaces.

	  If unsure, say N.

config BLOG_DEBUG
	bool "Binary Logging Debug Support"
	depends on BLOG
	default n
	help
	  Enable debug features for the binary logging infrastructure,
	  including memory poisoning, validation checks, and usage tracking.
	  This adds overhead and should only be enabled for debugging.

	  If unsure, say N.

config BLOG_MAX_CLIENTS
	int "Maximum number of logging clients"
	depends on BLOG
	range 16 1024
	default 256
	help
	  Maximum number of client IDs that can be used by modules.
	  Each module using BLOG can register multiple clients up to
	  this limit. The client ID is stored as u8, so maximum is 256.

config BLOG_MAX_SOURCES
	int "Maximum number of source locations"
	depends on BLOG
	range 256 16384
	default 4096
	help
	  Maximum number of unique source code locations (file/function/line)
	  that can be tracked. Each unique logging call site gets a source ID.

config BLOG_TRACK_USAGE
	bool "Track usage statistics"
	depends on BLOG_DEBUG
	default n
	help
	  Track usage statistics for logging operations, including counts
	  and bytes used in different contexts (task vs NAPI).

	  If unsure, say N.
